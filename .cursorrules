# Cursor Rules for Mana Drain RPG Finance Tracker

## Core Principles
- No unstyled HTML elements. Every element must have Tailwind classes or be a styled component.
- Always use lucide-react for icons. No other icon libraries.
- Mobile-first responsive design by default. Test on mobile breakpoints first.
- Use TypeScript strictly. No `any` types unless absolutely necessary.
- Follow the RPG game theme consistently throughout the UI.

## Code Style
- Use functional components with TypeScript.
- Prefer named exports over default exports for components.
- Use Framer Motion for all animations and transitions.
- Use Zustand for state management.
- Use Shadcn/UI components as base, customize for RPG theme.

## Design System
- Color palette: Dark slate-900 base with neon accents (cyan, purple, orange, gold).
- Typography: Orbitron for headings, Inter for body text.
- Motion: Standard 200ms ease-out transitions, Framer Motion variants for complex animations.
- Glassmorphic cards with neon borders and subtle glow effects.

## File Structure
- Components in `/components` directory.
- Utilities in `/lib` directory.
- Hooks in `/hooks` directory.
- Store in `/store` directory.
- Types in `/types` directory.

## Animation Guidelines
- All number changes should animate (use Framer Motion's useMotionValue and useSpring).
- Progress bars should fill smoothly with easing.
- Cards should have hover effects with glow intensification.
- Page transitions should be smooth and consistent.
